Alluding to Napoleon's famous defeat at Leipzig by Russia, Prussia, Austria and Sweden, chess historian Árpád Földeák summed up the event: \"Thus the 'Battle of Nations' was relived once again on a peaceful field...\" In conjunction with the tournament, the Stadtgeschichtlichen Museum organized an exhibit called \"Chess Through the Ages.\"1\n\nIn the two years since the last Olympiad, Tal had become world champion, and now took his throne on the USSR first board, followed by Mikhail Botvinnik, Paul Keres and Soviet champion Viktor Korchnoi. Vasily Smyslov and Tigran V Petrosian occupied the reserve boards.2 The preliminaries were played 17-27 October, and Tal sat out the first 3 rounds. He joined the fray with a victory over future FIDE president Florencio Campomanes, but gave up three draws before the finals, played 28 October - 9 November.1 Tal didn't mind drawing Robert James Fischer in final round 5, however, remarking that \"it was only after this encounter that he began to respect me.\"3 Tal went on to finish well, except for the last round, when he unaccountably lost to the untitled Englishman Jonathan Penrose. This loss cost him the gold medal on 1st board, which went to Karl Robatsch. Tal explained that the final round came a day before his birthday, which he wanted to be free. But the Soviet team captain insisted he play, prompting Tal to joke that he would therefore lose the game.3\n\nTal settled for the silver medal with a more than respectable score of +8 -1 =6. The USSR finished 1st over USA, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Argentina, West Germany and East Germany.2\n\nCheck out agadmator's merch here https://teespring.com/stores/agadmators-swag-store\nhttps://teespring.com/design-with-a-story-tm\n\nMailbox where you can send stuff:\n\nAntonio Radić\nAGADMATOR d.o.o.\nFranje Tuđmana 12\nCroatia\n48260 Križevci \np.s. this is not my home address :)\n\nContact me: agadmator@gmail.com \n\nVideo created by OBS\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or join me here https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nNANO nano_1h1kgfaq88t1btwadqzx73rbha5hwbb88sxmfns851kwj8hnosdj51w388xx\nMonero 4AdvvqmC4xhPyyRSAEDxTTAoXdxAtX2Py6b8Eh4EQzBLGbgo5rY5Khcap1x76JrDJH87yibAE9b6TPwTsvBAiFFCLtM8Be7\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AFWWCIBWCL5PGEPL73FDWK632F7Q/2QAGBMLVXE7MG\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992 \nJoin our Discord Server here https://discord.gg/bY6BbRP\n\n#youareawesome",
