Hear from our Global Ambassadors on their distribution efforts and hear how you can help us continue to spread The Gift of Chess across Africa and beyond.\n\nThe Gift of Chess Summer Charity Stream. Help us raise money to give The Gift of Chess to more countries. We currently have 50,000 chess sets in Africa with the hopes of reaching each country with 1,000 chess sets.\n\nIt costs approximately 5,000 to ship, clear customs and distribute 1,000 chess sets into a new country. Chess is a game with incredible societal benefit but unfortunately there is lack of chess sets in many countries globally. Help us expand opportunities by getting more chess sets into communities across the world.\n\nMailbox where you can send stuff:\n\nAntonio Radić\nAGADMATOR d.o.o.\nFranje Tuđmana 12\nCroatia\n48260 Križevci \np.s. this is not my home address :)\n\nContact me:  agadmator@gmail.com \n\nVideo created by OBS\n\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or join me here https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.ac...​\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5...​\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryou...​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/​\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator​\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992​ \nJoin our Discord Server here https://discord.gg/bY6BbRP",
