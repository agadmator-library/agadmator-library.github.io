    "title": "\"America's Greatest Puzzler\" - Sam Loyd's Excelsior",
    "description": "#agadmator Excelsior is the title of a famous problem composed by Sam Loyd in 1858.\nA friend of Loyd, Denis Julien, who also composed problems, had once said that any problem in chess, I could see immediately what the piece wouldn't do mate.\nThe incredible Loyd composed this problem. Soon after he showed to his friend. Julien said immediately what the piece would do mate, but this time was wrong.\n\nExcelsior\n \nTHE SHADES of night were falling fast,  \nAs through an Alpine village passed  \nA youth, who bore, 'mid snow and ice,  \nA banner with the strange device,  \n        Excelsior!          \n  \nHis brow was sad; his eye beneath,  \nFlashed like a falchion from its sheath,  \nAnd like a silver clarion rung  \nThe accents of that unknown tongue,  \n        Excelsior!   \n  \nIn happy homes he saw the light  \nOf household fires gleam warm and bright;  \nAbove, the spectral glaciers shone,  \nAnd from his lips escaped a groan,  \n        Excelsior!   \n  \n\"Try not the Pass!\" the old man said;  \n\"Dark lowers the tempest overhead,  \nThe roaring torrent is deep and wide!\"  \nAnd loud that clarion voice replied,  \n        Excelsior!   \n  \n\"Oh, stay,\" the maiden said, \"and rest  \nThy weary head upon this breast!\"  \nA tear stood in his bright blue eye,  \nBut still he answered, with a sigh,  \n        Excelsior!   \n  \n\"Beware the pine-tree's withered branch!  \nBeware the awful avalanche!\"  \nThis was the peasant's last Good-night,  \nA voice replied, far up the height,  \n        Excelsior!   \n  \nAt break of day, as heavenward  \nThe pious monks of Saint Bernard  \nUttered the oft-repeated prayer,  \nA voice cried through the startled air,  \n        Excelsior!   \n  \nA traveller, by the faithful hound,  \nHalf-buried in the snow was found,  \nStill grasping in his hand of ice  \nThat banner with the strange device,  \n        Excelsior!   \n  \nThere, in the twilight cold and gray,  \nLifeless, but beautiful, he lay,  \nAnd from the sky, serene and far,  \nA voice fell, like a falling star,  \n        Excelsior!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal.\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nLichess: agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nSkype: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator :)\nHearthstone: agadmator",
