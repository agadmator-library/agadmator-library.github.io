Nf7#\n\nCheck out the article by Edward Winter http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/young.html\n\nGeorge Stern (Canberra, Australia) writes:\n\n‘When I came across the following passage about F.K. Young by Lawrence J. Fuller on page 503 of Volume I of The Best of Chess Life and Review, my eyebrows went up in disbelief:\n\n“Mr Young was a contemporary of Steinitz, Zukertort and the American champions Mackenzie and Pillsbury, from all of whom he won games which he credited to his system.”\n\nCan it really be that F.K.Y. defeated Steinitz, Zukertort, Mackenzie and Pillsbury? If he did, why is the fact not better known? Why, indeed, did Young himself not boast about it – as a success of his system – in the lattermost of his “Strategetics” series, Chess Strategetics? There are all sorts of other puffery in the “Introductory” to that book, but no mention of victories over world-class contemporaries. Incidentally, I notice that in that book Young made this claim:\n\n“The synthetic method of chessplay ... early received the indorsement [sic] of Emmanuel [sic] Lasker, who, in a personal letter to Mr Edwin C. Howell, collaborator in Minor Tactics, stated that the new method of chess play ‘was replete with logic and common sense’.”\n\nI wonder too whether Young’s claim about Lasker is true. Can you or your correspondents shed any light on either of these matters?’\n\nFinding victories by Young is not easy, though his obituary on page 10 of the January 1932 American Chess Bulletin said that ‘in the middle ’80s, contemporary with George Hammond [sic –G.H. died in 1881], Preston Ware, C.F. Burrille [sic] and Charles B. Snow, he was one of the finest players in America’. In an off-hand queen’s knight odds game in Boston in April 1885 Young was defeated by Steinitz. The game appeared on pages 217-218 of the July 1885 issue of the International Chess Magazine. Steinitz described his opponent as ‘one of the strongest local players’ and believed that he ‘would be too strong for such odds in a serious contest’.\n\nNone of the standard sources seems to contain any games between Pillsbury and Young, but, by coincidence, Richard Lappin (Jamaica Plain, MD, USA) has just sent us a copy of a 1972 booklet Chess Was Front Page News ... 80 Years Ago, subtitled ‘A Salute to Harry N. Pillsbury’\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal, Bitcoin, Litecoin or Nano.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\nBitcoin address 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZ\nLitecoin address LbSuZuBffDCNmr5CSZbY7W2zM83w4ZvnC7\nNano address xrb_383y7ofu5wsyfr9o8rh93aqaq8aixpdcbaud5iubydukz5moiadsirmuzgoq\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nSteemit: https://steemit.com/@agadmator/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nJoin me on dock.io https://dock.io?r=antonioradic:aaabam3o\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992 \nCheck out my Hearthstone channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKefsd8PMI0FXHwPi5yscg\n\nCheck out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0SkpIiA\n\nSend your photos and videos here:\nsubscribers.videos.agadmator@gmail.com\n\nSend your own games here:\nsubscribers.games.agadmator@gmail.com",
