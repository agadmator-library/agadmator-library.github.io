    "description": "Get Barnes Merch here https://teespring.com/honor-the-barnes\n\nThis is the story of the birth of modern chess - when the possibilities of chess as an art, a science and a sport all converged.\nThe point of convergence was a young boy from Louisiana named Paul Morphy. At a time when America was seen as a backwoods nation with little cultural history and even less intellectual impetus, at a time when chess was considered the exclusive property of a few European countries, at a time when the game was played successfully by a handful of men wizened by years,  Paul Morphy, in the brief span of 19 months and with seemingly little effort, defeated conclusively every player he met.\nWhile today few non chess players even know his name,  he was one of the most famous celebrities of his time and within the hallowed halls of the chess playing community he is considered by some as the greatest chess player of all time.\nBut this diminutive, unassuming boy rose to fame almost out of nowhere and once he secured his place in history, he retired back into that hazy unknown, shunning the public eye, never again to play serious chess. Not only was he one of great practitioners of the game, but also one of it's greatest enigmas. He's been given the sobriquet,  The Pride and Sorrow of Chess.\n\nSource: http://www.edochess.ca/batgirl/index.html\n\nFollow me on Instagram for extra content https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\n\nDaniel Harrwitz vs Paul Morphy\n\"The Pipes Are Calling\" (game of the day Jun-27-2010)\nMorphy - Harrwitz (1858), Paris FRA, rd 3, Sep-09\nDutch Defense: Rubinstein Variation (A84)\n\npgn HERE https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1055942\n\nMaterials used in research: \nPaul Morphy: Pride and Sorrow of Chess by David Lawson\nThe Genius Of Paul Morphy by Chris Ward\n\nCheck out agadmator's merch here https://teespring.com/stores/agadmators-swag-store\nhttps://teespring.com/design-with-a-story-tm\n\nMailbox where you can send stuff:\n\nAntonio Radić\nAGADMATOR d.o.o.\nFranje Tuđmana 12\nCroatia\n48260 Križevci \np.s. this is not my home address :)\n\nContact me: agadmatormanga@gmail.com or agadmator@gmail.com \n\nDownload agadmator chess clock for iOS here https://apps.apple.com/us/app/agadmator-chess-clock/id1474461379?ls=1&fbclid=IwAR2lhuxf60tpbW1vcvfXgdFzmShi6fHcrKxFF_NAhu9wLQwpJrAFbMWRYjk\n\nDownload agadmator chess clock for Android here https://play.google.com/store/Qapps/details?id=com.agadmator.chessclock&fbclid=IwAR3b_sRch6nsuW59-bWoirVDMMJ8V5jexZdUB0bsxQrc0Q8imvkBtqkHUXQ&rdid=com.agadmator.chessclock\n\nVideo created by OBS\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address 3J7WigeEa95mNtZ8yJ26BBYexNz4r7XAUH\nBCH address qzx5tu8uelq7s4tavsnk628f2t2s3g8gdvvnvcrvuq\nLTC address MDrZdNjZm7btVkuLRdtrge9rwZn5TtjppM\nETH address 0x5840140C59C8b25AB59f0a3F6248c1f9cF1F2A0C\nNANO nano_1h1kgfaq88t1btwadqzx73rbha5hwbb88sxmfns851kwj8hnosdj51w388xx\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AFWWCIBWCL5PGEPL73FDWK632F7Q/2QAGBMLVXE7MG\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator 2992 \nJoin our Discord Server here https://discord.gg/bY6BbRP\n\n#MorphySaga",
