Delayed Keres Attack Perenyi Gambit (B90)\n\n\n1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cd4 4. Nd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e6 7. g4 e5 8. Nf5 g6 9. g5 gf5 10. ef5 d5 11. Qf3 d4 12. O-O-O Nbd7 13. Bd2 dc3 14.

Bd7 Rcc5 32. Bf5 Rf5 33. Rd1 Kg8 34. Qg2\n\nJudit Polgar was born July 23, 1976 in Hungary. She defeated an international master when she was 10 years old and an international grandmaster when she was 11. In 1991, she became a grandmaster at the age of 15 years and 4 months. At the time she was the youngest ever grandmaster. She has clearly been the best female chess player ever. Her peak position in the FIDE rating list was number eight.\n\nOpposing Polgar in this game is the present world champion, Viswanathan Anand who was seven years older. Polgar showed she was old enough and strong enough. However, both Polgar and Anand did not excel in the tournament in which this game was played. The event was Dos Hermanas 1999. The contestants and their scores were: Adams 6, Kramnik 5.5, Topalov 5, Illescas Cordoba 5, Gelfand 4.5, Karpov 4.5, Korchnoi 4, Anand 3.5, Svidler 3.5, and Polgar 3.5. Considering the ratings of the players, each one of them achieved a GM norm score. The winner, Adams, had three wins and six draws in nine games. No other player had more than two wins. Anand actually had no wins. Polgar did win two games, but lost four.\n\nThe opening became a Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense. The excitement was kicked up a notch with the Hungarian Attack or (Bela) Perneyi Variation with 7.g4. There are numerous game references and much analysis showing that players who step into this line are risk takers.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nNANO nano_1h1kgfaq88t1btwadqzx73rbha5hwbb88sxmfns851kwj8hnosdj51w388xx\nMonero 4AdvvqmC4xhPyyRSAEDxTTAoXdxAtX2Py6b8Eh4EQzBLGbgo5rY5Khcap1x76JrDJH87yibAE9b6TPwTsvBAiFFCLtM8Be7\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nLichess: agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nSkype: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator :)\nHearthstone: agadmator",
