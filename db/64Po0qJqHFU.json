Qf3\n\nIn 1901 the boy prodigy Jose Capablanca began play against Juan Corzo, the champion of Cuba, in an exhibition match. The match has sometimes been billed as being for the championship of Cuba, but that is incorrect. In April of 1902, the Cuban championship was played and Capablanca finished in fourth place with a minus score, losing both games to Corzo, who won the event.\nPrior to this match, Capablanca played eighteen games against ten players of Cuba. Eight opponents played him twice, two of his opponents played him only once. Clocks were used and Capablanca’s average rate of play was 140 moves an hour, his score being +13 =2 –3, his losses coming against Juan Corzo and his brother Enrique Corzo.\n\nCorzo was a fine middlegame tactician; he was the strongest player in Cuba, and would certainly rank as a candidate for master class. In the latter stages of the match considerable crowds gathered, and attendance had to be restricted to ticket-holders, whilst others waited outside. Capablanca’s victory created a local sensation; the Cubans were convinced that a new Morphy had arisen.\n\nTheir enthusiasm was short-lived. Capablanca was thoroughly trounced in the Cuban championship a few months later. In this double-round event he lost both of his games against J. Corzo.\n\nIt is not easy to explain Corzo’s defeat in the match. He was too old a hand to be affected by crowd sympathy or to be rushed into playing too fast against an opponent whose rate of play averaged ninety moves an hour. Perhaps he lost because of poor endplay; at all events Capablanca won two drawn endgames and saved three or four lost endgames. There is other evidence of this weakness of Corzo’s, that is, his comment on White’s forty-third move of the fourth match game.\n\nThe match was for the best of seven games, draws not counting. In the first eleven games Capablanca scored four wins against Corzo’s two, but they agreed to play on until the seventh win was notched up. As it happened the match ended with a loss – Hooper & Brandreth in The Unknown Capablanca.\n\nSource: http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=80396\n\nCheck out agadmator's merch here https://teespring.com/stores/agadmators-swag-store\nhttps://teespring.com/design-with-a-story-tm\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nNANO nano_1h1kgfaq88t1btwadqzx73rbha5hwbb88sxmfns851kwj8hnosdj51w388xx\nMonero 4AdvvqmC4xhPyyRSAEDxTTAoXdxAtX2Py6b8Eh4EQzBLGbgo5rY5Khcap1x76JrDJH87yibAE9b6TPwTsvBAiFFCLtM8Be7\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AFWWCIBWCL5PGEPL73FDWK632F7Q/2QAGBMLVXE7MG\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nSteemit: https://steemit.com/@agadmator/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992 \nCheck out my Hearthstone channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKefsd8PMI0FXHwPi5yscg\n\nCheck out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0SkpIiA\n\n#capablancastory",
