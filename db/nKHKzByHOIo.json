    "title": "Magnus Carlsen vs Najdorf specialist Maxime Vachier-Lagrave - Round 3 (GCT Paris 2017)",
    "description": "#agadmator It would seem that being a Najdorf specialist and playing computer moves is not enough to beat Carlsen :)\n\nMagnus Carlsen and Wesley So are tied for first place after day one of the Paris Grand Chess Tour. They scored 5 points out of a possible six (since the rapid games count double) and are just ahead of Hikaru Nakamura and Veselin Topalov.\n\nWhile the heat wave continued in Paris, the Grand Chess Tour saw a heart-warming first day. In a Canal+ studio along the Seine, in the south east corner of Boulogne-Billancourt, the chess players produced wonderful chess, watched by chess fans online as well as on television.",
