Reuben Fine wrote of him \"Playing over his early games is like reading Keats's poetry: you cannot help feeling a grievous, oppressive sense of loss, of promise unfulfilled\".\n\nCharousek was born in Klein Lometz (modern Lomeƒçek) near Prague, Bohemia. At the age of five weeks, his family moved to Debrecen, Hungary, where he became a naturalized Hungarian. They later moved to Miskolc where, at the age of 16, he learned to play chess. Studying law in Kassa, he is said to have copied out the voluminous Handbuch des Schachspiels by hand, unable to afford his own copy. Despite the lack of competition in Kassa, he soon became a strong player, and also qualified as a lawyer. In 1893 he entered a correspondence tournament organised by the Budapest newspaper Pesti Hirlap, in which he eventually shared first place with another up and coming Hungarian master, Geza Maroczy. He joined the Budapest chess club, where he frequently played with Maroczy and Gyula Makovetz, and convincingly defeated Gyozo Exner in a match.\n\nRudolf Rezso Charousek vs Jakob Wollner\n\"Char Broiler\" (game of the day Nov-04-2009)\nKaschau (1893), Apr-09 \nDanish Gambit: General (C21)\n\n1. e4 e5 2. d4 ed4 3. c3 dc3 4.
