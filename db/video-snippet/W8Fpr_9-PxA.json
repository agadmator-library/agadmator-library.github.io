  "title": "I Will Have My Revenge! | Bobby Fischer's First Win Against Mikhail Tal",
  "description": "#agadmator Bobby won from Tal, the latter’s only loss, and was the only one who went through the tournament undefeated! Tal won the tournament with 14.5 points, with Bobby second with 13.5. But Bobby beat Tal in their individual game, and so Bobby comes home a “moral” victor. Tal won 11, lost one and drew only seven games, his score 14.5, or 76.3%. Bobby won eight, lost none, and drew eleven games, scoring 13.5, or 71%. Bisguier won six, lost six, an drew nine games, scoring 9.5 points, or 50%.\n\nTal and Fischer were shoulder to shoulder through the 15th round, but in the final four rounds Bobby won only one game and drew three, scoring only 2.5 points; while in reverse, Tal drew one and won three, scoring 3.5. In round 16, Tal won from Germek, but Fischer only drew with Keres. Tal now led with 12 points, followed by Bobby with 11.5; and Gligoric and Petrosian with 11. In round 17, Bisguier beat Geller in excellent style. Tal against Pachman played eight consecutive Pawn moves in the opening, and still won. But Fischer only drew with Najdorf. Now Tal led by a whole point, having 13; Gligoric crept up alongside of Fischer, with 12; then came Petrosian with 11.5, and Keres with 11. In round 18, the next to the last round, Tal quickly drew his own game, expecting Petrosian to make quick work of Bobby, but when the latter defeated the USSR champion, the crowd roared. After round 18, Tal with 13.5, led Bobby by only half a point. If Bobby won his last round game, and Tal drew, they would be co-champions. Gligoric had 12.5; with Keres and Petrosian a point behind.\n\nBut in the final round, the 19th, Tal won against Najdorf, and Fischer only drew against Ivkov. Tal was first, and Fischer second. In the scramble for third place, Gligoric lost to Petrosian for his only loss in the tournament, and Keres beat Donner, thus bringing about a triple tie for third place between Gligoric, Keres and Petrosian.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nNANO nano_1h1kgfaq88t1btwadqzx73rbha5hwbb88sxmfns851kwj8hnosdj51w388xx\nMonero 4AdvvqmC4xhPyyRSAEDxTTAoXdxAtX2Py6b8Eh4EQzBLGbgo5rY5Khcap1x76JrDJH87yibAE9b6TPwTsvBAiFFCLtM8Be7\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ZOwHdNLO0&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nSkype: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\n\nCheck out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0SkpIiA\n\nSend your photos and videos here:\nsubscribers.videos.agadmator@gmail.com\n\nSend your own games here:\nsubscribers.games.agadmator@gmail.com",
