Qf6\n\nAron Nimzowitsch, (born November 7, 1886, Riga, Latvia, Russian Empireâ€”died March 16, 1935, Denmark), Latvian-born chess master and theoretician who was renowned for his book My System (1925) but failed to win a world championship, despite many attempts.\n\nNimzowitsch learned to play chess from his father, a wholesale merchant, when he was eight years old, but only after he entered the University of Berlin in 1904 did he concentrate on the game. My System, which advocates what came to be called the Hypermodern school of chess, remains a classic.\n\nNimzowitsch is best remembered for having created a new vocabulary for chess that made the strategy of the masters more intelligible. He also developed several theories of play, including the Nimzowitsch-Indian defense.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Bitcoin.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\nBitcoin adress 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZ\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ZOwHdNLO0&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: agadmator (new)\nLichess: agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nSkype: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator :)\nHearthstone: agadmator",
