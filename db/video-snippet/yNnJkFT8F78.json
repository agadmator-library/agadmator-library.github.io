The players start with bonus points based on their performance over the $1.6 million tour so far and then play a match each day for a maximum of 3 points. The top scorer after 9 rounds wins $100,000 and is crowned the Meltwater Champions Chess Tour champion.\n\nEach match features four rapid games with a time control of 15 minutes for all moves plus a 10-second increment added each move. The winner gets 3 points and the loser 0. If tied 2:2, then a blitz playoff is played, with two games where the players have 5 minutes and a 3-second increment. If still tied they play a single Armageddon game, where White has 5 minutes to Black’s 4, but a draw counts as a win for Black. The winner after a playoff gets 2 points, the loser 1.
