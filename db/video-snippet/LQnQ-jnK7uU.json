It goes a long way :) https://www.gofundme.com/f/10k-sets-for-education-prison-global-outreach\nTournament link here https://lichess.org/tournament/zEva4ZFj\n\nOver the coming year, The Gift of Chess hopes to significantly scale our impact across three of our four initiatives:\nYouth education (5,000 sets) - we want to put a choice-time kit into the hands of teachers in 1,000 elementary school classrooms across NYC, reaching 25,000 students!\n\nGlobal outreach (3,000 sets) - with outreach completed and underway in Nigeria, Uganda, and Kenya, we hope to bring 1,000 sets to an additional three African countries this year!\n\nPrison outreach (2,000 sets) - we plan to leverage our recently formed partnership with Exodus, a transitional community for the formerly incarcerated, to bring 2,000 sets to prison facilities and outreach programs across NYC and beyond this year!\n\nWe hope to raise a collective $50,000 to support these three initiatives by the end of September. Thank you in advance for your support of our mission of transforming lives through the universal language of chess! The Gift of Chess is a registered 501(c)(3) charity and all donations are tax-deductible.\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA/join\n\nCheck out agadmator's merch here https://teespring.com/stores/agadmators-swag-store\n\n00:00 Hello Everyone\n14:20 Sam Shankland\n47:32 Phylis\n1:14:50 Emmanuel Oke\n1:22:50 Tyrone Davis III\n1:32:30 Abhimanyu Mishra\n2:07:01 Tony Ballard (It gets louder)\n2:36:50 Tunde Onakoya\n\nMailbox where you can send stuff:\n\nAntonio Radić\nAGADMATOR d.o.o.\nFranje Tuđmana 12\nCroatia\n48260 Križevci \np.s. this is not my home address :)\n\nContact me:  agadmator@gmail.com \n\nVideo created by OBS\n\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or join me here https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.ac...​\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5...​\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryou...​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/​\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator​\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992​ \nJoin our Discord Server here https://discord.gg/bY6BbRP",
