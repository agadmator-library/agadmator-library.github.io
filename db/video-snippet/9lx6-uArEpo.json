However, he left Columbia University in 1910 without a degree and pursued a career in chess.[3] His first international success was his clear win (+8 -1 =14) over the former world championship challenger in Capablanca-Marshall (1909). After that, he was considered a worthy contender for the title of world champion, and reigning champion Emanuel Lasker commented \"Capablanca has shown himself to be a great player.\"\n\nCapablanca's admirers had suggested a title challenge as early as 1908. Even prior to his first European tournament, Le√≥n Paredes had suggested to Lasker that he play a match with Capablanca, but Lasker declined. Capablanca himself remained cautious. The hype surrounding Capablanca made Lasker admit that the subject got \"on his nerves.\" Capablanca made his international tournament debut at San Sebastian (1911).
