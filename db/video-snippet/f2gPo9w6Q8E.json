  "title": "Two Rusty Engines Go At it - TCEC Season 10 Rapid | Round 15",
  "description": "#agadmator Top Chess Engine Championship formerly known as Thoresen Chess Engines Competition (TCEC or nTCEC) is a computer chess tournament that was organized, directed, and hosted by Martin Thoresen until the end of Season 6; from Season 7 onward it has been organized by Chessdom. It is often regarded as the Unofficial World Computer Chess Championship because of its strong participant line-up and long time control matches on high-end hardware, giving rise to very high-class chess.[1][2]\n\nThe first TCEC season was held in 2010. After a short break in 2012,[3] TCEC was restarted in early 2013 (as nTCEC)[4] and is currently active (renamed as TCEC in early 2014) with all-day live broadcasts of chess matches on its website. Supported by original engine authors and based on voluntarism and donation, it caused a furor in February 2011, when the free version of Houdini defeated reigning computer chess champion Rybka in a 40-game match.[5][6]\n\nThe current season of TCEC is sponsored by Chessdom Arena.[7][8] The current TCEC champion is Houdini 6.03, which defeated Komodo in the TCEC Season 10 Superfinal 100-game match held in Novemberâ€“December 2017.\n\nTexel 1.07a35 - Bobcat 8\nTCEC Season 10 Rapid round 15\n\n1.
