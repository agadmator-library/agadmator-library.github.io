Larsen had qualified from the Larsen - Uhlmann Candidates Quarterfinal (1971). Fischer said to a reporter before the match: \"Been traveling for a year, match to match. I need a personal life. I'm not as narrow as some people think, you know. But right now all I think of is the world championship. Chess is my whole life\" ... \"(Larsen)'s good. But I think I'm the best around. I don't say that to brag. I think it's true. I love the game - and I hate the Russians because they've almost ruined it. They only risk the title when they have to, every three years. They play for draws with each other but play to win against the Western masters. Draws make for dull chess, wins make for fighting chess.\" (1)\n\nAnd fighting chess is what Fischer delivered. After six consecutive wins he dispensed with Denmark's best, repeating another amazing 6-0 performance. Preparing to face Boris Spassky in a World Championship match, he would first meet the winner of the Petrosian - Korchnoi Candidates Semifinal (1971). This turned out to be Petrosian, hence the Fischer - Petrosian Candidates Final (1971). \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal, Bitcoin, Litecoin or Nano.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\nBitcoin address 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZ\nLitecoin address LbSuZuBffDCNmr5CSZbY7W2zM83w4ZvnC7\nNano address xrb_383y7ofu5wsyfr9o8rh93aqaq8aixpdcbaud5iubydukz5moiadsirmuzgoq\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AFWWCIBWCL5PGEPL73FDWK632F7Q/2QAGBMLVXE7MG\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nSteemit: https://steemit.com/@agadmator/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992 \nCheck out my Hearthstone channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKefsd8PMI0FXHwPi5yscg\n\nCheck out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0SkpIiA\n\nSend your photos and videos here:\nsubscribers.videos.agadmator@gmail.com\n\nContributors:\nDame Pletvarec $20.00\nBernhard Flohr $15.00\nDaniel Larsson $20.00\nChristopher Latvys $25.00\nPrabhakar Krishna $20.00\nTravis Twigg $30.00\nStedenIndex.nl B.V. $5.00\nGregory Molev 30.00 CAD\nMonique Casteel $40.00\nGuy Phillips $10.00\nChristopher Amolsch $100.00\nMatthew Bell $100.00\nGil Troitsa $55.00\nLinas Sudzius $50.00\nDanny McCullagh $15.00\nRobin Wier $50.00\nCody Travis $50.00\nMohammed Hisham Moll $10.00\nWarren Beck $50.00\nNiklot Stüber 5.00€\nRay Fowler $2.000.00\n\n#agadmator #bobbyfischer #bobbyfischerstory",
