Qh6\n\nGiving up a pawn for the sake of a single soon-to-be-isolated passed pawn. Kasparov remarks that pawn sacrifices of this type are frequently seen in GM games today as opposed to traditional chess and even in contrast to the partially Karpov-influenced style of the 1980s. In his words, “the new generation says that initiative can be worth material and that this is more appreciated than before.” He claims that he himself “contributed to the changing philosophy.” Indeed, I remember being surprised time and again by Kasparov’s early pawn sacrifices, which were quite unlike ones that I was used to. But these are fast-moving times, and today such a sacrifice looks almost routine and is often passed over without even an ‘!’, so deeply have such ideas penetrated our thinking.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal.\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nLichess: agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nSkype: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator :)\nHearthstone: agadmator",
