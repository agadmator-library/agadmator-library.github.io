  "description": "Read the Manga here https://agadmator.com/manga\nIf you really, reallllly like our project, you are welcome to support it with a small contribution here https://www.paypal.me/agadmatormanga\n\nFinally – it’s here – Chess manga – Age of Caissa. Over a year in prep, this was a huge creative effort of a small but focused team of artists, writers, scientists, philosophers (yes, really) and what we end up with is not just a manga (available free online or bought and shipped) but a vast, fully-fledged world – set in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian age, where the world is ruled by chess-playing robots and – well, let us not spoil it. Launching with my new website, you will find there not just the manga but also concept art, short stories, and other material from this universe. I’m sure anyone with any interest in chess – or AI, philosophy of mind, computability,  graphic novels or hard sci-fi will find this to be an enjoyable read.",
