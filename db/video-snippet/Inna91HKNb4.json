This time, however, he conceived of a more rigorous format, with the ten players (five Soviets and five foreigners) in a double round robin competition. The lineup was impressive, with Capablanca and Lasker being invited back a third time to compete in Moscow, in addition to the previous year's winners, Botvinnik and Flohr. The tournament was held in Moscow's famous Hall of Columns from May 14 to June 8. Capablanca's near flawless accuracy and superiority in the endgame proved to be instrumental in winning first prize by a full point over the future world champion Botvinnik. Lasker, who had always finished ahead of his successor to the crown in prior tournaments, started out strongly, but at 67 years of age he became fatigued more easily and his performance suffered during the second cycle. The tournament brought immense excitement and interest, both to the citizens of the Soviet Union and to the greater world at large. Capablanca's first place was to be one of the last successes against the Soviet Chess School before the triumph of Robert James Fischer 36 years later. It was also the last hurrah for Krylenko, the founder and organizer of the tournament. He was arrested in January 1938, tried and executed later that year.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal, Bitcoin, Litecoin or Nano.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\nBitcoin address 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZ\nLitecoin address LbSuZuBffDCNmr5CSZbY7W2zM83w4ZvnC7\nNano address xrb_383y7ofu5wsyfr9o8rh93aqaq8aixpdcbaud5iubydukz5moiadsirmuzgoq\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AFWWCIBWCL5PGEPL73FDWK632F7Q/2QAGBMLVXE7MG\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nSteemit: https://steemit.com/@agadmator/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992 \nCheck out my Hearthstone channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKefsd8PMI0FXHwPi5yscg\n\nCheck out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0SkpIiA\n\nSend your photos and videos here:\nsubscribers.videos.agadmator@gmail.com\n\nSend your own games here:\nsubscribers.games.agadmator@gmail.com",
