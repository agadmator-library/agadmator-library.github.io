Just because I decided not to go to Saudi Arabia. Not to play by someone's rules, not to wear abaya, not to be accompanied getting outside, and altogether not to feel myself a secondary creature. Exactly one year ago I won these two titles and was about the happiest person in the chess world but this time I feel really bad. I am ready to stand for my principles and skip the event, where in five days I was expected to earn more than I do in a dozen of events combined. All that is annoying, but the most upsetting thing is that almost nobody really cares. That is a really bitter feeling, still not the one to change my opinion and my principles. The same goes for my sister Mariya - and I am really happy that we share this point of view. And yes, for those few who care - we'll be back!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNatalia Zhukova vs Anna Muzychuk\nWorld Rapid Championship (Women) (2016), Doha QAT, rd 1, Dec-26 \nKing's Indian Defense: Normal.
