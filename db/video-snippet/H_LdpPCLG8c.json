Nd2 Qd2 42. e6 b1Q\n\nIn 1913, Jose Raul Capablanca visited Russia to play a series of exhibition knock-out matches against his three adversaries. The conditions to win the gold cup presented by Monsieur Savorin were that Capablanca would win it if he did not lose any game of a match against each of the three others. Otherwise, the trophy would be awarded to the opponent with the best score against him. Eugene Aleksandrovich Znosko-Borovsky was declared the winner after he tied his match 1-1 and also won the stakes' side-pot. \nThe matches lasted between December 12th-23rd, but it doesn't seem to be certain in the stipulations whether any of the matches may have been extended past 2-0, should Capablanca have won each game that would been preceded by Christmas. Perhaps the stakes may have increased if the cup-winner or winner of the side-stakes did have to be decided beyond 6 games, but there does not seem to be any indication of how long the rounds of the cup might hae been scheduled for.\n\nCheck out agadmator's merch here https://teespring.com/stores/agadmators-swag-store\nhttps://teespring.com/design-with-a-story-tm\n\nColor photo of capablanca https://klimbim2014.wordpress.com/2016/03/07/jose-raul-capablanca-a-color-cuban-chess-player-who-was-world-chess-champion-from-1921-to-1927/\n\nColor photo of Alekhine and Capablanca https://klimbim2014.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/jose-raul-capablanca-vs-alexander-alekhine-1913/\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal, Bitcoin, Litecoin or Nano.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\nBitcoin address 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZ\nLitecoin address LbSuZuBffDCNmr5CSZbY7W2zM83w4ZvnC7\nNano address xrb_383y7ofu5wsyfr9o8rh93aqaq8aixpdcbaud5iubydukz5moiadsirmuzgoq\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AFWWCIBWCL5PGEPL73FDWK632F7Q/2QAGBMLVXE7MG\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nSteemit: https://steemit.com/@agadmator/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992 \nCheck out my Hearthstone channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKefsd8PMI0FXHwPi5yscg\n\nCheck out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0SkpIiA\n\n#capablancastory",
