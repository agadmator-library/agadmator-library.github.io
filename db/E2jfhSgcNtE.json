Instead of being behind, his minor pieces (knights and bishops) completely dominated the board. He executed a series of forcing moves (a “windmill” tactic) that drove Byrne’s king across the board and eventually delivered mate on move 41.\n\nThis game stunned the chess world — a teenager defeating a seasoned master with such creativity and precision. It instantly marked Fischer as a prodigy and earned its title as the Game of the Century.\n\nCheck out agadmator's merch here https://teespring.com/stores/agadmators-swag-store\r\nhttps://teespring.com/design-with-a-story-tm\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal, Bitcoin, Litecoin or Nano.\r\n\r\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\r\nBitcoin address 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZ\r\nLitecoin address LbSuZuBffDCNmr5CSZbY7W2zM83w4ZvnC7\r\nNano address xrb_383y7ofu5wsyfr9o8rh93aqaq8aixpdcbaud5iubydukz5moiadsirmuzgoq\r\n\r\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AFWWCIBWCL5PGEPL73FDWK632F7Q/2QAGBMLVXE7MG\r\n\r\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\r\n\r\nSteemit: https://steemit.com/@agadmator/\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\r\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\r\nChess.com: agadmator\r\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\r\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992 \r\nCheck out my Hearthstone channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKefsd8PMI0FXHwPi5yscg\r\n\r\nCheck out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0SkpIiA\r\n\r\nSend your photos and videos here:\r\nsubscribers.videos.agadmator@gmail.com\r\n\r\nSend your own games here:\r\nsubscribers.games.agadmator@gmail.com",
