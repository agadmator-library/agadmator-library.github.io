    "title": "Morphy Misses Mate in 5 After A Queen Sac - Can YOU Spot it?",
    "description": "#agadmator Paul Morphy had everything necessary for success that one could think of. He had a wealthy family, was a hard worker, had an astounding mind, and was well liked by nearly all the people he knew. Yet throughout his life he was met with failure and sadness. His near perfect circumstances and tumultuous final year of life earned him the nickname by which he will forever be remembered, “The Pride and Sorrow of Chess.”\n\nThe first American Chess Congress was held in New York City from October 6th to November 10th, 1857. Daniel Fiske and Thomas Frere were the organizers, and the tournament was designed with similarities to the London (1851) format, with the provision that draws did not count and had to be replayed. The first prize was $300. The 16 best American masters were invited to participate in the event, including Paul Morphy and Louis Paulsen. Morphy dominated the event, sweeping each of his opponents until Paulsen in the final. Despite dropping one game in the final match, Morphy finished the tournament with an astounding 14 wins, 3 draws, and 1 loss.\nNot one to accept money for chess, Morphy turned down the cash prize in exchange for a silver tray, pitcher, and four goblets in its place. His victory cemented him as one of the best players in the world (if not the best), and prompted his tour across the Atlantic where he faced the best Europe had to offer in a series of matches, winning each and every one of them. Not long after his return to America, Morphy would retire from chess.\n\nLouis Paulsen vs Paul Morphy\n\"Morphy Us\" (game of the day Nov-25-2007)\n1st American Chess Congress (1857), New York, NY USA, rd 4, Nov-03 \nFour Knights Game: Spanish.
