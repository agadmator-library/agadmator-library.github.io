According to legend, Marshall saved this prepared innovation for eight years before getting the chance to play it against Capablanca. This seems unlikely, and in fact the gambit had been played earlier in a few obscure games including a consultation game in Havana, although there's no evidence that Marshall knew of these games. Capablanca weathered the Black attack and won brilliantly. Improvements to Black's play were found (Marshall played 11...Nf6 instead of 11...c6) and the Marshall Attack was adopted by top players including Boris Spassky.\n\nNew York 1918 was originally planned as an 8-player double round robin tournament. Norman Tweed Whitaker began a game a day before Round 1, became ill and withdrew from the event, leaving it as a 7-player field. New York (1924) appears to be the next international tournament that the city would see in this series. (1)\nRound 1 saw the most famous game of the tournament. Marshall sprung his prepared variation of what has come to be known as the Marshall Gambit, but Capablanca wove his way through the complications at the board to win the game. Kostic drew with Chajes. In Round 2, Marshall lost to Chajes, and Marshall was never able to overcome the bad 0-2 start and catch Capablanca and Kostic. Janowski lost to the eventual tail-ender, Morrison, and this was the beginning of a lackluster result for him. In Round 4, Marshall beat Janowski, but this was a bit too late to reverse his fortunes. Kostic beat Morrison, but drew five of his first six games. Despite going undefeated in the tournament, this would not be a sufficiently fast pace to catch Capablanca, who would score a blistering 10.5/12.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nNANO nano_1h1kgfaq88t1btwadqzx73rbha5hwbb88sxmfns851kwj8hnosdj51w388xx\nMonero 4AdvvqmC4xhPyyRSAEDxTTAoXdxAtX2Py6b8Eh4EQzBLGbgo5rY5Khcap1x76JrDJH87yibAE9b6TPwTsvBAiFFCLtM8Be7\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ZOwHdNLO0&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/agadmatorchess\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nSkype: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator :)\n\nCheck out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0SkpIiA\n\nSend your photos and videos here:\nsubscribers.videos.agadmator@gmail.com\n\nSend your own games here:\nsubscribers.games.agadmator@gmail.com",
