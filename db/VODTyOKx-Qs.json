    "description": "#agadmator Footage of the tournament appeared in the silent film Chess Fever (Shakhmatnaya Goryachka) and footage of Capablanca was shot in Moscow for the film. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8ARyB1Dado\n\nAt the end of the USSR Championship (1925), Efim Bogoljubov emerged as the champion. He had participated as a Russian national although he was living in Triberg, Germany at the time. Nikolai Vasilyevich Krylenko, head of the Soviet Chess Association, in an effort to popularize chess in the Soviet Union, organized an international tournament of the scope seen in New York (1924) a year earlier. (1) The event was held in the Metropol Hotel in Moscow (2) from November 7 to December 10. In addition to the Soviet Champion, ten foreign masters, including Emanuel Lasker and Jose Raul Capablanca, the former and current World Champions respectively, and ten Soviet players were invited to compete in the round robin format. Before the start of the tournament pundits expected a repeat of New York, with Capablanca and Lasker racing each other to the finish, but once it was under way Bogoljubov was the one who performed supremely, ultimately winning the tournament ahead of the two favorites. His victory was hailed as a Soviet triumph, and in truth the tournament was an unprecedented success for the Revolution. Hundreds of Soviet citizens gathered at the hotel to follow the games, and tens of thousands across the country awaited news from Moscow each day. The celebration would be a bittersweet one for Soviet Russia, however, as Bogoljubov would never participate in another Soviet event. He defected a year later and eventually became a German citizen, earning him the moniker \"renegade\" (as Alekhine had). It was also a tournament that would be of enormous historical importance.\n\nCarlos Torre Repetto vs Emanuel Lasker\n\"Seventh Seal\" (game of the day Jul-31-2007)\nMoscow (1925), Moscow URS, rd 12, Nov-25 \nTorre Attack: Classical Defense (A46)  Â·  1-0 \n\n1. d4 Nf6 2.
