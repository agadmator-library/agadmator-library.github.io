    "description": "#agadmator Viswanathan Anand vs Alexander Grischuk\nTal Memorial (Rapid) (2018), Moscow RUS, rd 8, Mar-04 \nSicilian Defense: Nezhmetdinov-Rossolimo Attack. Fianchetto Variation (B31)\n\n1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6 4. Bc6 dc6 5. d3 Bg7 6. h3 Nf6 7. Nc3 O-O 8. Be3 b6 9. Qd2 e5 10. Bh6 Qd6 11. O-O-O a5 12. g4 a4 13. Kb1 Be6 14. Ne2 b5 15. Ng3 Rfd8 16.

Qh6\n\nComing into the final day of the Tal Memorial , Indian GM Vishwanathan Anand shared the lead along with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov with 4 points out of a possible. Two players: Kramnik and Grischuk were close behind on with 3.5/6.\n\nBut Anand won a way to keep his head and grab the title with some solid chess. A win against against Hikaru Nakamura in the sixth round had got Anand back in and he continued his good run on the final day with a vital win over Alexander Grischuk in the eighth round.\n\nAs luck would have it, Mamedyarov lost to Daniil Dubov in the 8th round as well and that is all that was needed to decide the title.\n\nAnand had only one loss in the tournament – losing to Mamedyarov in the third round. But he also racked up four outright wins and that is big for a tournament in which the average rating was 2757.\n\nThe Candidates tournament is about to begin in a week, yet four of them are playing here: Kramnik, Karjakin, Mamedyarov and Grischuk. The win comes soon after Anand’s World Rapid title and will give his confidence another big boost.\n\nThe Tal Memorial Rapid is a 10-player single round-robin taking place in the Museum of Russian Impressionism in Moscow. The ten top players were competing for a $130,000 prize fund, with $25,000 for 1st place.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nNANO nano_1h1kgfaq88t1btwadqzx73rbha5hwbb88sxmfns851kwj8hnosdj51w388xx\nMonero 4AdvvqmC4xhPyyRSAEDxTTAoXdxAtX2Py6b8Eh4EQzBLGbgo5rY5Khcap1x76JrDJH87yibAE9b6TPwTsvBAiFFCLtM8Be7\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ZOwHdNLO0&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nSkype: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\n\nCheck out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0SkpIiA\n\nSend your photos and videos here:\nsubscribers.videos.agadmator@gmail.com\n\nSend your own games here:\nsubscribers.games.agadmator@gmail.com",
