    "description": "Paul Morphy vs Adolf Anderssen\n\"Morphology\" (game of the day Aug-25-2009)\nAnderssen - Morphy (1858), Paris FRA, rd 9, Dec-27 \nSicilian Defense: Paulsen. Szen Variation (B44)\n\n1. e4 1 c5 2. d4 cd4 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Nd4 e6 5. Nb5 d6 6. Bf4 6 e5 7. Be3 f5 8. N1c3 8 f4 9. Nd5 fe3 10. Nbc7 Kf7 11. Qf3 Nf6 12. Bc4  12 Nd4 13. Nf6 d5 15. Qh5 Kf6 16. fe3 Nc2 17. Ke2\n\nAfter having cemented his status, by virtue of his triumph 1st American Chess Congress (1857), as one of the greatest masters in the world, Morphy traveled to Europe to play Howard Staunton and other chess greats. Morphy made numerous attempts at setting up a match with Staunton, but none ever came to fruition. Staunton was later criticised for avoiding a match with Morphy. Seeking new opponents, Morphy crossed the English Channel to France.\n\nIn Paris, Morphy suffered from a bout of intestinal influenza. In accordance with the medical wisdom of the time, he was treated with leeches, resulting in his losing a significant amount of blood. Although too weak to stand up unaided, Morphy insisted on going ahead with a match against the visiting German master Adolf Anderssen, considered by many to be Europe's leading player. Despite his illness Morphy triumphed easily, winning seven while losing two, with two draws. When asked about his defeat, Anderssen claimed to be out of practice, but also admitted that Morphy was in any event the stronger player and that he was fairly beaten. Anderssen also attested that in his opinion, Morphy was the strongest player ever to play the game, even stronger than the famous French champion Louis Charles Mahe De La Bourdonnais.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nNANO nano_1h1kgfaq88t1btwadqzx73rbha5hwbb88sxmfns851kwj8hnosdj51w388xx\nMonero 4AdvvqmC4xhPyyRSAEDxTTAoXdxAtX2Py6b8Eh4EQzBLGbgo5rY5Khcap1x76JrDJH87yibAE9b6TPwTsvBAiFFCLtM8Be7\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: agadmator\nLichess: agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nSkype: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator :)\nHearthstone: agadmator",
