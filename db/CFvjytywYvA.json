At a time when America was seen as a backwoods nation with little cultural history and even less intellectual impetus, at a time when chess was considered the exclusive property of a few European countries, at a time when the game was played successfully by a handful of men wizened by years,  Paul Morphy, in the brief span of 19 months and with seemingly little effort, defeated conclusively every player he met.\nWhile today few non chess players even know his name,  he was one of the most famous celebrities of his time and within the hallowed halls of the chess playing community he is considered by some as the greatest chess player of all time.\nBut this diminutive, unassuming boy rose to fame almost out of nowhere and once he secured his place in history, he retired back into that hazy unknown, shunning the public eye, never again to play serious chess. Not only was he one of great practitioners of the game, but also one of it's greatest enigmas. He's been given the sobriquet,  The Pride and Sorrow of Chess.\n\nFollow me on Instagram for extra content https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\n\nPaul Morphy vs Adolf Anderssen\nAnderssen - Morphy (1858), Paris FRA, rd 3, Dec-22\nSpanish Game: Berlin Defense (C65)\n\n1. e4 Notes by Lowenthal 1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 Nd4 5. Nd4 ed4 6. e5 c6 A weak move and the cause of all subsequent embarrassment. 7. O-O cb5 8. Bg5 Much stronger play then taking the Knight at once. 8... Be7 The only correct reply. If ...h6 White can play either Re1 or exf6 and in each case win with ease. 9. ef6 Bf6...gxf6 would have been equally bad, for White's reply would have been Qxd4, with a won game. 10. Re1 Kf8 11. Bf6 Qf6 12. c3 d5 13. cd4 Be6 14. Nc3 a6 15. Re5 Rd8 16. Qb3 Qe7 17. Rae1 Vigorously and ably followed up. 17... g5 Apprehensive of the advance of the f pawn. 18. Qd1 Qf6 19. R1e3 Rg8 Losing the game offhand; it was previously, however, past all recovery. 20.
