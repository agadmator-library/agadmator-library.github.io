    "description": "#agadmator Baskaran Adhiban vs Richard Rapport\nReykjavik Open (2018), Reykjavik ISL, rd 8, Mar-13 \nSlav Defense: Geller Gambit (D15)\n\n1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 dc4 5. e4 b5 6. Be2 e6 7. O-O Be7 8. a4 b4 9. e5 bc3 10. ef6 Bf6 11. bc3 Ba6 12. Ne5 Be5 13. de5 Qd1 14. Rd1 Nd7 15. f4 Nb6 16. Rd6 O-O 17. Bf3 Nc8 18. Rc6 Bb7 19. Rc8 Rac8 20. Bb7 Rb8 21. Ba6 Rb3 22. Ba3 Rd8 23. Bb4 Rd2 24. Bc4 Rbb2 25. Bf1 h5 26. a5 a6 27. Bc5 g6\n\nThere was loads of action in the 8th and penultimate round of the GAMMA Reykjavik Open. Before the round, Rapport and Adhiban led with 6 out of 7 and their matchup on board one was highly anticipated. Very surprsingly and after interesting opening play by Adhiban, Rapport blundered horribly missing a simple tactic. To Adhibans credit he was much better at that point but the blunder meant that the board 1 clash was one of the fastest games of the round to finish!\n\nThe only other notable game to finish faster was the short repetition draw between Sarin and his countryman Vaibhav. Sarin went for the repetition to secure his 2nd Grandmaster norm. This talented young man is on his way to big things and the Grandmaster title is only a matter of time at this point!\n\nAdhiban for a while looked like he would be leading by a full point before the last round before a crucial series of events on board 2. Daniel Fernandez had been pushing a small edge and trying to win in the endgame when he reached too far and basically lost all his pawns and had to resign. This was so traumatic for him that he withdrew for the last round which is not something one wants to be known for!\n\nThis sets up a final round clash between Mustafa Yilmaz with white against Baskaran Adhiban with black. The math is simple. If Adhiban holds the draw or wins, he is the winner of the tournament. If Yilmaz manages to win with white he will be the winner of the 2018 GAMMA Reykjavik Open!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal, Bitcoin, Litecoin or Nano.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\nBitcoin address 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZ\nLitecoin address LbSuZuBffDCNmr5CSZbY7W2zM83w4ZvnC7\nNano address xrb_383y7ofu5wsyfr9o8rh93aqaq8aixpdcbaud5iubydukz5moiadsirmuzgoq\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ZOwHdNLO0&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nSteemit: https://steemit.com/@agadmator/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nSkype: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\n\nCheck out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0SkpIiA\n\nSend your photos and videos here:\nsubscribers.videos.agadmator@gmail.com\n\nSend your own games here:\nsubscribers.games.agadmator@gmail.com",
