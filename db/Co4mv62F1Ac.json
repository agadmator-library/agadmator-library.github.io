This time, however, he conceived of a more rigorous format, with the ten players (five Soviets and five foreigners) in a double round robin competition. The lineup was impressive, with Capablanca and Lasker being invited back a third time to compete in Moscow, in addition to the previous year's winners, Botvinnik and Flohr. The tournament was held in Moscow's famous Hall of Columns from May 14 to June 8. Capablanca's near flawless accuracy and superiority in the endgame proved to be instrumental in winning first prize by a full point over the future world champion Botvinnik. Lasker, who had always finished ahead of his successor to the crown in prior tournaments, started out strongly, but at 67 years of age he became fatigued more easily and his performance suffered during the second cycle. The tournament brought immense excitement and interest, both to the citizens of the Soviet Union and to the greater world at large. Capablanca's first place was to be one of the last successes against the Soviet Chess School before the triumph of Robert James Fischer 36 years later. It was also the last hurrah for Krylenko, the founder and organizer of the tournament. He was arrested in January 1938, tried and executed later that year.\n\nJose Raul Capablanca vs Nikolai Nikolaevich Riumin\nMoscow (1936), Moscow URS, rd 3, May-16 \nOld Indian Defense: General (A53)\n\n1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3.
