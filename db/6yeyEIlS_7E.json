    "description": "Levon's Tweet https://twitter.com/LevAronian/status/1244724856526180353\n\nAlthough chess was one of the most important aspects in her life, and she became a WIM and also a 2300+ player, it wasn't the only thing in which Arianne excelled. She was the managing director of Akron, a strategy consulting firm. She was also in the team of advisors to the head of Armenian government. She founded and managed one of the biggest newspapers in Armenia — Champord Weekly — which is distributed on public transport for free. In 2018, Arianne did something truly special. In order to raise funds for child education and donate it to Children of Armenia Fund, she decided to bike 2000 kilometres from city of Ayas in Cilicia to Agarak located on the Armenian-Iranian border. Her aim was to raise US$ 5,500, which she exceeded by collecting US$6,016 in two weeks.\n\nArianne spoke several languages fluently, and had studied for a Ph.D. at a German university on \"Russian foreign policy, especially its economic and business relations with Armenia on a state and individual level\". She was a wonderful dancer and always tried to excel at everything that she did, be it dancing, boxing or mountain climbing.\n\nArianne's concept was always to have tough goals in front of herself, which would challenge her and stretch her limits. No matter how tough the path would be, she always took pain and difficulty in her stride to build her mental toughness. This was also the reason why one of her key ambitions was to spread chess among girls at a global level. According to her, chess builds mental toughness and is an ideal tool to empower young girls.\n\nArianne and Levon Aronian first met in 1996, at the World Youth Chess Championships in Las Palmas, and became friends in 2006, being introduced by their mutual friend Alex Wohl. They got officially engaged in 2015 and got married on 30 September 2017 at the 13th-century Saghmosavank Monastery, with Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan and his wife Rita Sargsyan in attendance.\n\nArianne was an overachiever. She was a go-getter. The things she achieved at the age of 33 years is what most people wouldn't be able to do in a lifetime. The world has lost an intelligent, beautiful, talented, hard working and a loving soul. As they say, life is not measured by the number of breathes you take, but by the moments that take our breath away. And Arianne lived many such moments. We will miss you, Arianne.\n\nSource: https://chessbase.in/news/Arianne-Caoili-passes-away-at-the-age-of-33?fbclid=IwAR1qlKm58xPH8Tv5TBqt8W9qdQ0NyJHurTD3dU9L84oliT79U9rQq50z4Nw\n\nArianne Caoili vs Benjamin Arvola Notkevich\nLondon Chess Classic Open (2012), London ENG, rd 6, Dec-06\nDutch Defense: General (A80)\n\n1. d4 f5 2.
