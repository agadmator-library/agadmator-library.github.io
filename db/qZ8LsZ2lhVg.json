After that, he was considered a worthy contender for the title of world champion, and reigning champion Emanuel Lasker commented \"Capablanca has shown himself to be a great player.\"\n\nCapablanca's admirers had suggested a title challenge as early as 1908.

The hype surrounding Capablanca made Lasker admit that the subject got \"on his nerves.\" Capablanca made his international tournament debut at San Sebastian (1911).
