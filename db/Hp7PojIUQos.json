The first \"Turnir solidarnosti\" featured a field of twelve Yugoslavian chess masters headed by grandmaster Milan Matulovic. Visiting participants included Peter Dely from Hungary, Luben Popov from Bulgaria, and Bela Soos from Romania. As was expected, the Soviet Union sent emissaries to participate as well in the guise of two veteran grandmasters, Efim Geller and Ratmir Kholmov. This was perhaps calculated on the Soviet Chess School's part as the final participant was Bobby Fischer, who participated on behalf of the United States. Fischer had just recently returned to regular international competition and Skopje would be an important stop on his road to the Sousse Interzonal (1967), which he announced he would be participating in later in the year. Going into this event, Matulovic, Geller, and Kholmov all had plus scores against Fischer, making them excellent choices to potentially stifle the upstart American's chances. And stifle it almost did: Fischer lost his second round game to Geller, and after the ninth round, despite being tied for first with Kholmov ahead of Geller, Fischer announced he would withdraw from the tournament unless the chess sets were modified and the spectators removed from further rounds. The organizers were in a panic as they could not meet the second demand and Fischer forfeited his tenth round game. However, upon Fischer's arrival to complete an adjourned game, a compromise within the playing hall was reached and Fischer was allowed to replay his tenth round game. Despite this drama, Fischer found his form, defeating both Matulovic and Kholmov in their encounters in the latter half of the tournament, and securing clear first by a hair's breadth.\n\nCheck out agadmator's merch here https://teespring.com/stores/agadmators-swag-store\r\nhttps://teespring.com/design-with-a-story-tm\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal, Bitcoin, Litecoin or Nano.\r\n\r\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\r\nBitcoin address 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZ\r\nLitecoin address LbSuZuBffDCNmr5CSZbY7W2zM83w4ZvnC7\r\nNano address xrb_383y7ofu5wsyfr9o8rh93aqaq8aixpdcbaud5iubydukz5moiadsirmuzgoq\r\n\r\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AFWWCIBWCL5PGEPL73FDWK632F7Q/2QAGBMLVXE7MG\r\n\r\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\r\n\r\nSteemit: https://steemit.com/@agadmator/\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\r\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\r\nChess.com: agadmator\r\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\r\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992 \r\nCheck out my Hearthstone channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKefsd8PMI0FXHwPi5yscg\r\n\r\nCheck out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0SkpIiA\r\n\r\nSend your photos and videos here:\r\nsubscribers.videos.agadmator@gmail.com\r\n\r\nSend your own games here:\r\nsubscribers.games.agadmator@gmail.com",
