Eighteen grandmasters and six masters participated in the round-robin event at the Habana Libre hotel from August 25 to September 26, 1965. It was one of the best-funded tournaments at the time, due to Ché Guevara's patronage. As the director of the Cuban National Bank and Minister of Industry, he guaranteed a $3000 first prize with more than $4500 to be dispersed among the next five finishers. This edition of the memorial gained worldwide significance because it was the first international tournament in which Bobby Fischer would be participating since the Curacao Candidates (1962), more than three years before. He had agreed to attend for a $3000 appearance fee, but difficulties arose when the US State Department refused him a visa to travel to Cuba. When Fischer suggested playing by telex from the Marshall Chess Club, the organizers agreed although it would end up costing them over $10,000. Although Fischer had been playing regularly in US championships in the intervening three years (and winning them all), this tournament would mark the first time Fischer would be facing a number of the strongest Soviet grandmasters since his accusations against them for conspiring to keep him from winning the Candidates Tournament to challenge Botvinnik in 1963. Fischer's main Soviet rivals at this event were former world champion Vasily Smyslov, Efim Geller and Ratmir Kholmov.\n\nBorislav Ivkov led for most of the tournament, but suffered a tragic collapse at the end. In the penultimate round, with a won game against the tailender Garcia, he blundered and had to resign. In the last round, with White against Robatsch, he played for a win, but lost again. This enabled Smyslov to finish first by one-half point, despite losing to Fischer in their individual game. Fischer shared second place with Geller and Ivkov. Kholmov joined the top finishers in fifth place.\n\nCheck out agadmator's merch here https://teespring.com/stores/agadmators-swag-store\nhttps://teespring.com/design-with-a-story-tm\n\nMailbox where you can send stuff:\n\nAntonio Radić\nAGADMATOR d.o.o.\nFranje Tuđmana 12\nCroatia\n48260 Križevci \np.s. this is not my home address :)\n\nContact me: agadmator@gmail.com \n\nVideo created by OBS\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or join me here https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nNANO nano_1h1kgfaq88t1btwadqzx73rbha5hwbb88sxmfns851kwj8hnosdj51w388xx\nMonero 4AdvvqmC4xhPyyRSAEDxTTAoXdxAtX2Py6b8Eh4EQzBLGbgo5rY5Khcap1x76JrDJH87yibAE9b6TPwTsvBAiFFCLtM8Be7\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AFWWCIBWCL5PGEPL73FDWK632F7Q/2QAGBMLVXE7MG\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992 \nJoin our Discord Server here https://discord.gg/bY6BbRP\n\n#youareawesome",
