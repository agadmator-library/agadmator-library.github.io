However, he left Columbia University in 1910 without a degree and pursued a career in chess.[3] His first international success was his clear win (+8 -1 =14) over the former world championship challenger in Capablanca-Marshall (1909). After that, he was considered a worthy contender for the title of world champion, and reigning champion Emanuel Lasker commented \"Capablanca has shown himself to be a great player.\"\n\nCapablanca's admirers had suggested a title challenge as early as 1908. Even prior to his first European tournament, León Paredes had suggested to Lasker that he play a match with Capablanca, but Lasker declined. Capablanca himself remained cautious. The hype surrounding Capablanca made Lasker admit that the subject got \"on his nerves.\" Capablanca made his international tournament debut at San Sebastian (1911). He unexpectedly won 1st prize, a result even he hadn't anticipated.[9] About seven months after this success, he challenged Lasker to a title match.]\n\nRead more here http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=54111\n\nCheck out agadmator's merch here https://teespring.com/stores/agadmators-swag-store\nhttps://teespring.com/design-with-a-story-tm\n\nColor photo of capablanca https://klimbim2014.wordpress.com/2016/03/07/jose-raul-capablanca-a-color-cuban-chess-player-who-was-world-chess-champion-from-1921-to-1927/\n\nVideo created by OBS\n\nBusines contact: agadmator@gmail.com\nSuggestions and fun contact: agadmatormanga@gmail.com\n\nMailbox where you can send stuff:\nAGADMATOR d.o.o.\nFranje Tuđmana 12\nCroatia\n48260 Križevci \np.s. this is not my home address :)\n\nContact me agadmatormanga@gmail.com or agadmator@gmail.com\n\nVideo created by OBS\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal, Bitcoin, Litecoin or Nano.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\nBitcoin address 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZ\nLitecoin address LbSuZuBffDCNmr5CSZbY7W2zM83w4ZvnC7\nNano address xrb_383y7ofu5wsyfr9o8rh93aqaq8aixpdcbaud5iubydukz5moiadsirmuzgoq\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AFWWCIBWCL5PGEPL73FDWK632F7Q/2QAGBMLVXE7MG\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nSteemit: https://steemit.com/@agadmator/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992 \nCheck out my Hearthstone channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKefsd8PMI0FXHwPi5yscg\n\nCheck out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0SkpIiA\n\n#capablancastory",
