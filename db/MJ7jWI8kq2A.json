Each division is a double-elimination knockout where if you lose one match you drop down to a Losers bracket and can still win the tournament. In the Grand Final if the player from the Winners bracket loses, there's a rematch. The total prize fund is $235,000, with a top prize of $30,000 (150 Tour points) in Division I, $10,000 in Division II (50 points) and $5,000 (20 points) in Division III. The top 3 in Division I and the winner of Division II qualify straight to Division I of the next event on the Tour.\n\nThe time control for normal games is 15 minutes per player for all moves, with a 3-second increment each move. In Division I and II the Winners bracket matches are played over four games, while in the Losers bracket there are two games. In Division III all matches are over two games except the 4-game Grand Final. A tie in a match is decided by an Armageddon game with no increment, where the players bid for time they are willing to play with. The lowest bidder gets that time and can pick colour, while the opponent gets 15 minutes. Black only needs a draw to win the match.
