Ke1\n\nFinal\nLeela versus Houdini then.\nLeela again seemed in control of the game and defended without any problems when she was with black and with white created some problems for Houdini but without anything much more than just applying some pressure where Houdini managed to draw eventually. \n\n So after first 7 games were draws, last game(8) before tiebreaks, was a very sharp and double edged opening Leela decided to get into, where she played some nice speculative attacking moves trying to apply pressure to the weak Kingside so Houdini had to be very careful, even though Houdini had a very strong counterplay with 2 advanced passed Pawns on the Queenside so Leela should had that in mind too. But Houdini played 2 suboptimal moves that can maybe even characterized as mistakes or blunders, but not that obvious mistakes though and more analysis is needed as position is crazy complicated, and Leela grasped the chance to attack! The attack went great and Leela played some nice attacking Chess and she played move 31 playing fxe5 with a +3.16 score while Houdini was at +0.47 and Stockfish dev 176 threads (that was kibitzing the game) didn't see fxe5 and was preferring 31.Rf1 with +1.11. After Leela played 31.fxe5 and after 2 more moves having been played the 176 thread Stockfish jumped to +3.03 seeing indeed that Leela's move was sound and superb. \n After that it was more or less over so Leela went on to win and win the final and the CUP!\n\nSource https://blog.lczero.org/2019/02/leela-won-tcec-cup.html\n\nCheck out agadmator's merch here https://teespring.com/stores/agadmators-swag-store\nhttps://teespring.com/design-with-a-story-tm\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal, Bitcoin, Litecoin or Nano.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\nBitcoin address 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZ\nLitecoin address LbSuZuBffDCNmr5CSZbY7W2zM83w4ZvnC7\nNano address xrb_383y7ofu5wsyfr9o8rh93aqaq8aixpdcbaud5iubydukz5moiadsirmuzgoq\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AFWWCIBWCL5PGEPL73FDWK632F7Q/2QAGBMLVXE7MG\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nSteemit: https://steemit.com/@agadmator/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992 \nCheck out my Hearthstone channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKefsd8PMI0FXHwPi5yscg\n\nCheck out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0SkpIiA\n\n#lc0",
