The winner becomes the World Junior Champion and receives 2,500 Euros and the GM title. The 2nd and 3rd placed players receive the IM title.\n\nTari has played chess since the age of five. He won the Junior section of the Norwegian Chess Championship in 2012,qualifying him for the championship section in 2013. Following an eighth place finish in 2013 and a second place finish in 2014, Tari won the 2015 Championship. At age 16 he is the third youngest player to achieve this feat, after Simen Agdestein and Magnus Carlsen who won at age 15.\n\nAt the Open Norwegian Championship in Fagernes in March 2013, Tari finished in seventh place and scored a grandmaster norm, the second youngest Norwegian player ever to have done so at the time.\n\nTari secured his second grandmaster norm over nine rounds at the 2015 European Team Chess Championship in Reykjavik where he played Norway's third board and scored six points. A special FIDE clause for the continental team championships regards this as a 20-game norm which together with his norm from Fagernes and rating over 2500 is sufficient for the grandmaster title; this title was awarded at the FIDE congress in March 2016. He was Norway's 12th player to be awarded this title.\n\nPhoto by David Llada\n\nWinners of the giveaway:\n\nMatthew Zeimer\nunapocacosa\nXadrez E Café\nMohammad Arif\nBergg Guner\n\nLuka Jović - chess set\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Bitcoin.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\nBitcoin adress 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZ\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ZOwHdNLO0&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nSkype: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator :)\nHearthstone: agadmator",
