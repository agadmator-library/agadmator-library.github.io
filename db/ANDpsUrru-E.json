Previously, Iceland had hosted the World Students Team Championship (1957), in which Mikhael Tal participated, (1) and Reykjavik (1960), which was won by Robert James Fischer. The tournament started a tradition later known as the Reykjavik Open. (2) It was organized by the Icelandic Chess Federation and the Reykjavík Chess Club, and was held in memory of Petur Zophoniasson (1879-1946), who was a founder of the club and one of the pioneers of chess in Iceland. (1) It seems that the tournament director (mótstjóri) was Eiður Gunnarsson. (3) The invitation of players from abroad afforded the promising Icelandic players an opportunity to receive training, and to achieve title norms. (4) The total prize budget was $1200, with $400 to the winner, and $300 to the runner-up. There were seven prizes. The entry fee for the public was 50 Icelandic kronor, and it was also possible to buy a round ticket for 500 kronor. This included access to the playing area at any time. (5)\n\nFive players were invited from abroad: Mikhail Tal (world champion 1960-1961), Svetozar Gligoric (Yugoslav champion), Robert Wade (British champion 1952), Nona Gaprindashvili (women's world champion), and Svein Johannessen (Norwegian champion).\n\n00:00 Hello Everyone\n02:05 Game Starts\n05:00 PAUSE THE VIDEO!\n07:40 PAUSE THE VIDEO 2!\n08:20  It Was In This Position\n10:35 Hidden move!\n12:34 Contributions\n\nCheck out agadmator's merch here https://teespring.com/stores/agadmators-swag-store\nhttps://teespring.com/design-with-a-story-tm\n\nMailbox where you can send stuff:\n\nAntonio Radić\nAGADMATOR d.o.o.\nFranje Tuđmana 12\nCroatia\n48260 Križevci \np.s. this is not my home address :)\n\nContact me: agadmatormanga@gmail.com or agadmator@gmail.com \n\nDownload agadmator chess clock for iOS here https://apps.apple.com/us/app/agadmator-chess-clock/id1474461379?ls=1&fbclid=IwAR2lhuxf60tpbW1vcvfXgdFzmShi6fHcrKxFF_NAhu9wLQwpJrAFbMWRYjk\n\nDownload agadmator chess clock for Android here https://play.google.com/store/Qapps/details?id=com.agadmator.chessclock&fbclid=IwAR3b_sRch6nsuW59-bWoirVDMMJ8V5jexZdUB0bsxQrc0Q8imvkBtqkHUXQ&rdid=com.agadmator.chessclock\n\nVideo created by OBS\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or join me here https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nNANO nano_1h1kgfaq88t1btwadqzx73rbha5hwbb88sxmfns851kwj8hnosdj51w388xx\nMonero 4AdvvqmC4xhPyyRSAEDxTTAoXdxAtX2Py6b8Eh4EQzBLGbgo5rY5Khcap1x76JrDJH87yibAE9b6TPwTsvBAiFFCLtM8Be7\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AFWWCIBWCL5PGEPL73FDWK632F7Q/2QAGBMLVXE7MG\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992 \nJoin our Discord Server here https://discord.gg/bY6BbRP\n\n#youareawesome",
