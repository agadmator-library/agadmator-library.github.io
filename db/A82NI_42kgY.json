Kc1 Rc2#\n\nThe Game of the Century is a chess game played between 26-year-old Donald Byrne and 13-year-old Bobby Fischer in the Rosenwald Memorial Tournament in New York City on October 17, 1956, which Fischer won. The competition took place at the Marshall Chess Club. It was nicknamed \"The Game of the Century\" by Hans Kmoch in Chess Review. Kmoch wrote, \"The following game, a stunning masterpiece of combination play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies.\n\nBobby Fischer was a record-setting chess master who became the youngest player to win the U.S. Chess Championship at 14, and the first American-born player to win the World Chess Championship.\n\nEarly Life\nRobert James Fischer was born in Chicago, Illinois, on March 9, 1943. Fischer's parents divorced when he was a toddler, and he began learning chess at the age of 6 after his older sister Joan bought him a chess set. He continued to hone his skills as a youngster at the Brooklyn Chess Club and Manhattan Chess Club. Fischer had a strained relationship with his mother, who supported his chess endeavors, but preferred that he pursue other areas of interest.\nA brilliant, highly competitive player who lost himself in the game, Fischer earned a place in the record books at age 14 when he became the youngest player to win the U.S. Chess Championship. Then in 1958, at 15, he became the youngest international grand master in history by winning the related tournament in Portoroz, Yugoslavia (now Slovenia). \n\nMatch of the Century\nDuring the early 1960s, Fischer continued to be involved in U.S. and world championship matches, but was also making a name for himself with his erratic, paranoid commentary. After having a 20-game winning streak in the early 1970s, Fischer once again made chess history in 1972 with his defeat of the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky at the Reykjavik, Iceland world championships, thus marking the first time an American chess player had won the title. Fischer's defeat of a Soviet opponent, which became known as the \"Match of the Century,\" took on iconic proportions in the midst of the Cold War and was seen as a symbolic victory of democracy over Communism. Fischer's historic win also made chess a popular game in the United States. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nNANO nano_1h1kgfaq88t1btwadqzx73rbha5hwbb88sxmfns851kwj8hnosdj51w388xx\nMonero 4AdvvqmC4xhPyyRSAEDxTTAoXdxAtX2Py6b8Eh4EQzBLGbgo5rY5Khcap1x76JrDJH87yibAE9b6TPwTsvBAiFFCLtM8Be7\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AFWWCIBWCL5PGEPL73FDWK632F7Q/2QAGBMLVXE7MG\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5ZLdHz8&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992 \nJoin our Discord Server here https://discord.gg/bY6BbRP\n\np.s. if you work in Twitter or Instagram, help me get Verified :)\n\n #gameofthecentury",
