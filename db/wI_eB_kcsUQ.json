    "description": "https://r.immortal.game/acf5689384\n\nWhat is Immortal Game?\n\nChess is a game that needs no introduction. With an origin that can be traced back some 1500 years, it has adopted various iterations as it spread across the globe, before settling on the variation we all know and love in the early 16th century. To say it is popular would be a vast understatement, given the fact that over 70% of the entire world’s population have played chess at some point in their lives, and an estimated 605 million actively play on a regular basis.\nThe timeless relevance of chess in a fast-moving world has often been attributed to its stimulating use of reasoning and logic, which harmonize perfectly with its competitive and adventurous elements. In addition, technological advancements over the years have allowed increased adoption by presenting the game in entirely new ways, such as through AI opponents, on computers and phones, and globally across the web.\n\nRead more here https://immortal.game/wiki/understanding-immortal-game\n\n\n\nMailbox where you can send stuff:\n\nAntonio Radić\nAGADMATOR d.o.o.\nFranje Tuđmana 12\nCroatia\n48260 Križevci \np.s. this is not my home address :)\n\nContact me:  agadmator@gmail.com \n\nVideo created by OBS\n\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or join me here https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.ac...​\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5...​\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryou...​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/​\nLichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmator​\nChess.com: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)\nBlizzard: agadmator #2992​ \nJoin our Discord Server here https://discord.gg/bY6BbRP",
