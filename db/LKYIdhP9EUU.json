Bxe5 \n\nThe chess24 Legends of Chess is the 4th stage of the $1 million Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour and features Magnus Carlsen and his predecessors as World Champion Vishy Anand and Vladimir Kramnik. It consists of two stages, a 10-player preliminary, where each player plays each other once, followed by a knockout among the top 4. Prelim ties are played as 4-game rapid matches, while knockout ties are the best of 3 such matches. The prize fund is $150,000, with $45,000 for first place, while the winner also qualifies for the $300,000 Grand Final.\n\nThe time control is 15 minutes for all moves with a 10-second increment from move 1. The winner of a preliminary tie decided in rapid games gets 3 points. If the score is 2:2 an Armageddon game is played, where White has 5 minutes to Black's 4 but a draw counts as a win for Black. A winner in Armageddon gets 2 match points, while the loser gets 1. The knockout format is the same except before Armageddon there are two 5+3 blitz games. No draw offers are allowed before move 40.
