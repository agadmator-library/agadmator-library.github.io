The 8 players include defending Champion Wesley So and World Champion Magnus Carlsen. The players are split into 2 groups of 4 players, with the top 2 in each group advancing to the knockout stages. All games are Chess960, with the players given 15 minutes to study the randomly drawn starting position before play. At stake is $400,000, with $150,000 for the winner.\n\nThe time control is 25 minutes for 30 moves, plus 5 minutes for the remainder of the game, with a 5-second increment from move 31. In the group stage players play a 2-game match against each rival, with 2 points for the winner and 1 point each for a draw. In the knockout stages each match is over 4 games, with a tie decided by a single Armageddon game, where White has 15 minutes. The player with Black only needs a draw, with the player chosen by a bidding war won by the player bidding the lowest starting time.
