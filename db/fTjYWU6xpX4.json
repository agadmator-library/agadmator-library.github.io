    "title": "Morphy Destroys his Childhood Friend With Rook and Knight Odds! Amazing game :)",
    "description": "#agadmator Paul Morphy had everything necessary for success that one could think of. He had a wealthy family, was a hard worker, had an astounding mind, and was well liked by nearly all the people he knew. Yet throughout his life he was met with failure and sadness. His near perfect circumstances and tumultuous final year of life earned him the nickname by which he will forever be remembered, “The Pride and Sorrow of Chess.”\n\nAs most folks interested in Paul Morphy know, Charles Amédée de Maurian had been his best friend since childhood.  Paul's father and Charles' father (also Charles) were both lawyers, judges and politicos in New Orleans and lived near and associated with each other.  Alonzo Morphy and Charles Maurian the elder were witnesses to the marriage of Judah Benjamin, later the Confederate Attorney-General and Sec. of War, to Natalie Bauché de St. Martin.  Paul and Charles went to school together in New Orleans and later in Moblie, Alabama.  Charles has the magnificant distinction of having been the only person tutored in chess by Paul Morphy.  Outside of Morphy, Maurian became the strongest player in the Crescent City. He founded and was first president of the New Orleans Chess, Checkers and Whist Club in 1880 and edited the chess columns in the New Orleans Delta and later in the New Olreans Times-Democrat\n\nRead the entire article here. https://www.chess.com/blog/batgirl/charles-de-maurians-obituary-of-paul-morphy\n\nPaul Morphy vs Charles Maurian\n\"Against All Odds\" (game of the day Jun-16-2008)\nNew Orleans (1854) \nChess variants (000)\n\n1. e4 e6 2. f4 d5 3. e5 Ne7 4.
