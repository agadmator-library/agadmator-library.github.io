Ke3\n\nTo have a challenger for World Champion Anatoly Karpov it was necessary to qualify eight players for the Candidates quarterfinal knockout matches that would be held in 1980. Viktor Korchnoi and Boris Spassky had qualified by having reached the Korchnoi - Spassky Candidates Final (1977/78). The other six players would qualify from two interzonal tournaments: Riga (this page), and Rio de Janeiro Interzonal (1979). From Rio, Robert Huebner, Lajos Portisch and Tigran Vartanovich Petrosian qualified.\n\nTo play in the interzonals the players had to qualify from zonal tournaments. For the Riga interzonal, Miles had qualified from the Amsterdam Zonal (1978) tournament. Grünfeld qualified from the Lucerne Zonal (1979), Tarjan and Mednis from the US Championship (1978), Rodriguez from Ito Zonal (1978), Adorjan, Ribli and Gheorghiu from Warsaw Zonal (1979), Ljubojevic and Bouaziz from Praia da Rocha Zonal (1978), Tseshkovsky, Romanishin and Kuzmin from Lvov Zonal (1978) and Trois and Riemsdijk from Tramandai Zonal (1978). (1) Larsen and Polugaevsky qualified from reaching the Candidates matches in 1977. (2) Mikhail Tal from the host country had a wild card, which had caused protests in Russia. (3) Roman Hernandez was originally situated in the draw as no. 1, but on his failure to arrive his name was withdrawn and the draw was modified. Lubomir Kavalek had qualified from the USA zone, but due to an injury to a leg, while playing tennis as part of his physical preparation, he could not travel and his place was taken by Mednis. Vlastimil Hort withdrew at the last moment through sickness, and was replaced by Romanishin.
