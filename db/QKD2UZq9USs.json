He was unable to recreate the same form after the war, and his later life was plagued by mental illness.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal.\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryou...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nLichess: agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nSkype: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator :)\nHearthstone: agadmator",
