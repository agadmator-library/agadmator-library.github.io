    "title": "He Tried to Embarrass Paul Morphy",
    "description": "Start the Morphy Saga here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV-bSA0RHGI\nWatch game 1 here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DuAnKNFLs\n\nGet Barnes Merch here https://teespring.com/honor-the-barnes\n\nThis is the story of the birth of modern chess - when the possibilities of chess as an art, a science and a sport all converged.\nThe point of convergence was a young boy from Louisiana named Paul Morphy. At a time when America was seen as a backwoods nation with little cultural history and even less intellectual impetus, at a time when chess was considered the exclusive property of a few European countries, at a time when the game was played successfully by a handful of men wizened by years,  Paul Morphy, in the brief span of 19 months and with seemingly little effort, defeated conclusively every player he met.\nWhile today few non chess players even know his name,  he was one of the most famous celebrities of his time and within the hallowed halls of the chess playing community he is considered by some as the greatest chess player of all time.\nBut this diminutive, unassuming boy rose to fame almost out of nowhere and once he secured his place in history, he retired back into that hazy unknown, shunning the public eye, never again to play serious chess. Not only was he one of great practitioners of the game, but also one of it's greatest enigmas. He's been given the sobriquet,  The Pride and Sorrow of Chess.\n\nSource: http://www.edochess.ca/batgirl/index.html\n\nFollow me on Instagram for extra content https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/\n\nPaul Morphy vs Jabez Carr\nBlindfold simul, 8b (1858) (blindfold), Birmingham ENG, Aug-27\nCarr Defense: General (B00)\n\n1. e4 Notes by J.

O-O Ba6 This series of unusual moves was no doubt adopted with the view of embarrasing the blindfold player, in place of which it served to allow him to bring out his pieces and secure victory in a shorter space of time. 6. c4 Nf6 7. e5 Nh7 8. f4 Be7 9.
