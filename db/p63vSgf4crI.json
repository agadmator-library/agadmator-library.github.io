    "description": "#agadmator The US Chess Championship (1) played in New York City from December 15th, 1963 to January 2nd, 1964 was the sixth to be attended by American prodigy and world's youngest grandmaster, Bobby Fischer. In addition to Fischer, six other US grandmasters, including former American champions Samuel Reshevsky, Arthur Bisguier, and Larry Evans, three US international masters, and two untitled players competed in a round robin event for the US chess crown. Fischer had won all five of the previous championships he had previously participated in and expectations for performance this time were quite high. Never one to disappoint when it came to chess results, Fischer completely annihilated the competition by earning a perfect score of eleven wins out of eleven games played. Afterwards, Dr. Hans Kmoch jokingly congratulated the runner-up Evans on winning the tournament, then congratulated Fischer on \"winning the exhibition.\"\n\nRobert James Fischer vs Pal Benko\n\"Rook, Line and Sinker\" (game of the day May-24-2006)\nUS Championship (1963/64), New York, NY USA, rd 10, Dec-30 \nPirc Defense: Austrian Attack.
