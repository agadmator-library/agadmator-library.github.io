It was a 21-player round robin, with the top six players qualifying for the Bled-Zagreb-Belgrade Candidates (1959) tournament, with the proviso that no more than four players from any one country could advance. (1) The chief arbiter Harry Golombek was assisted by Vladimir Vukovic. (2) The tournament committee was composed of Gligoric, Averbakh, Neikirch, Rossetto and Ozren Nedeljkovic. The prize money for 1st through 12th places was 300.000, 225.000, 200.000, 150.000, 120.000, 100.000, 80.000, 60.000, 50.000, 45.000, 40.000, and 30.000 dinari. The remaining players received 2.000 dinari for each point scored. Several special prizes were also offered. The opening ceremony featured the debut of the FIDE Hymn, composed by Dal Verme. (2)\n\nThe tournament was won by Mikhail Tal with 13.5/20 (+8 =11 -1).
