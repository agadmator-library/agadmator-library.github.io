    "description": "#agadmator Though it is 16 years since Bobby Fischer won the world championship and subsequently retired from competitive chess, his legend will always be with us. Whenever I give a public appearance, the perennial question always asked me is, ``Whatever happened to Bobby Fischer? And how do you explain his disappearance from the game that had always totally absorbed him?'' Being a chessplayer and not a psychologist, I can do no better than to quote from world champion Gary Kasparov. In his book ``Child of Change,'' he called Fischer his boyhood idol, noting that Bobby was ``a classic case of someone who became mentally trapped inside the game, a prisoner of chess who got lost in its depths and could not find his bearings in the real world outside, a victim of obsession.'' Rumors constantly reappear about the possibility of his playing again or making public appearances, but the only published games that we know of since 1972 were against the Greenblatt program, and they were submitted by Bobby himself and published in the Computer Chess Newsletter. Bobby sent the scores of three games in which he massacred the computer. In his comments on the games, Bobby noted that the computer was very weak and that he could give it great odds and still beat it. The comment does not surprise me, as I recall that when he was US champion he once boasted to me that he could give knight odds to any woman in the world and still win.\n\nRobert James Fischer vs Greenblatt (Computer)\n\"Greenblatt with Envy\" (game of the day Apr-08-2007)\nComputer Match (1977), Cambridge, MA USA \nKing's Gambit: Accepted.

Qh6#\n\nBobby Fischer was a record-setting chess master who became the youngest player to win the U.S. Chess Championship at 14, and the first American-born player to win the World Chess Championship.\n\nBobby Fischer was born on March 9, 1943, in Chicago, Illinois. Fischer first learned the game of chess at age 6 and eventually became the youngest international grand master at the age of 15. In 1972, he became the first American-born world chess champion after defeating Boris Spassky. An eccentric genius, who was believed to have an I.Q. of 181, Fischer became known for his controversial public remarks in his later years. He was granted Icelandic citizenship in 2005, following legal trouble with the United States. He died on January 17, 2008.\n\nEarly Life\nRobert James Fischer was born in Chicago, Illinois, on March 9, 1943. Fischer's parents divorced when he was a toddler, and he began learning chess at the age of 6 after his older sister Joan bought him a chess set. He continued to hone his skills as a youngster at the Brooklyn Chess Club and Manhattan Chess Club. Fischer had a strained relationship with his mother, who supported his chess endeavors, but preferred that he pursue other areas of interest.\nA brilliant, highly competitive player who lost himself in the game, Fischer earned a place in the record books at age 14 when he became the youngest player to win the U.S. Chess Championship. Then in 1958, at 15, he became the youngest international grand master in history by winning the related tournament in Portoroz, Yugoslavia (now Slovenia). \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Crypto.\n\nLink to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmator\n\nMaiar Wallet @agadmator or https://get.maiar.com/referral/pv0mam6l2a\nBTC address bc1qckd3ut0hqyymzv33eus97ld8klj02xhk2kcwld\nBCH address qzmfclyn69hqhjslls40r7r0dsttwe3tcsl946w4fr\nLTC address Laarf1RmvCpLt2BcSwC1PBLG3hRC4HjBrz\n\nNANO nano_1h1kgfaq88t1btwadqzx73rbha5hwbb88sxmfns851kwj8hnosdj51w388xx\nMonero 4AdvvqmC4xhPyyRSAEDxTTAoXdxAtX2Py6b8Eh4EQzBLGbgo5rY5Khcap1x76JrDJH87yibAE9b6TPwTsvBAiFFCLtM8Be7\nFor any other currency address, contact me via agadmator@gmail.com\n\nCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ZOwHdNLO0&list=PLDnx7w_xuguFTxcfiM11bB1JchtHclEJg\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryoutube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/agadmator\nInstagram: agadmator (new)\nLichess: agadmator\nChess.com: agadmator\nSkype: agadmator\nLeague of Legends: agadmator :)\nHearthstone: agadmator",
